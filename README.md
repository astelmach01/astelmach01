## Hi there! 👋 I'm Andrew Stelmach.
🏫 I'm a student at Northeastern University with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with and supporting cool projects.

### 🔭 My Projects
Here are some of the projects I've created:

### 🦜 [tinylang](https://github.com/astelmach01/tinylang) A barebones langchain

#### 📬 [Telegram API](https://github.com/astelmach01/TelegramAPI) A REST API for Telegram Clients. Originally made to support my Pipedrive Provider API, this can be extended to use convert the annoying MTProto protocol to be compatible with REST.

#### 🤖 [AgentGPT](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT) : A project that allows you to assemble, configure, and deploy autonomous AI agents in your browser.

#### 🏀 [NBA](https://github.com/astelmach01/NBA) (in-progress): Scrapes and analyzes NBA stats to make more informed sports betting decisions.

#### 🎵 [Spotify](https://github.com/astelmach01/Spotify): Provides song recommendations based on a classic Feed Forward architecture and a Variational Autoencoder architecture.

#### 🍄 [Mario-Q_Learning](https://github.com/astelmach01/Mario-Q_Learning): Deep Q-learning to beat Mario Bros.
