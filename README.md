## Hi there! 👋 I'm Andrew Stelmach.
🏫 I'm a student at Northeastern University with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with and supporting cool projects.

### 🔭 My Projects
Here are some of the projects I've contributed to:

####  [Telegram API](https://github.com/astelmach01/TelegramAPI) A REST API for Telegram Clients. Originally made to support my Pipedrive Provider API, this can be extended to use convert the annoying MTProto protocol to be compatible with REST.

#### 🤖 [AgentGPT](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT) : A project that allows you to assemble, configure, and deploy autonomous AI agents in your browser.

#### 🏀 NBA (in-progress): A Python project that scrapes and analyzes NBA stats to make more informed sports betting decisions.

#### 🎵 Spotify: A Python project that interacts with the Spotify Web API to fetch information about users' playlists and tracks.

#### 🍄 Mario-Q_Learning: A Python project that uses Q-learning to teach an agent how to beat Mario Bros level.
