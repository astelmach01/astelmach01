## Hi there! 👋 I'm Andrew Stelmach.
🏫 I'm a student at Northeastern University with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with and supporting cool projects.

### 🔭 My Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

#### 🤖 AgentGPT: A project that allows you to assemble, configure, and deploy autonomous AI agents in your browser. Actively contributing.

#### 🤖 Auto-GPT: An experimental open-source attempt to make GPT-4 fully autonomous. I forked this project and plan to make some contribution.

#### 🏀 NBA (in-progress): A Python project that scrapes and analyzes NBA stats to make more informed sports betting decisions.

#### 🎵 Spotify: A Python project that interacts with the Spotify Web API to fetch information about users' playlists and tracks.

#### 🍄 Mario-Q_Learning: A Python project that uses Q-learning to teach an agent how to beat Mario Bros level.

### 🌱 Learning and Exploring
I'm always looking to learn and explore new technologies. Some areas I'm currently interested in include:

- Web Development
- Reinforcement Learning
- Blockchain technology
